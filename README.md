# FlappyBirds
Implementation of the Flappy Birds game on the Intel DE1-SoC FPGA board using an 8x8 red-green LED display. Class project for UW EE 271: Digital Circuit and Systems with Scott Hauck.

This project is designed and built from scratch by Doruk Arisoy.

Top module for this project is <code>DE1_SoC.sv</code>

Not all submodules are used in this specific project, some of them are from pervious projects. This repository can be viewed as a library of all modules built in class.

All modules include a testbench and ".do" files to simulate them on ModelSim.

Thank you Dr. Hauck for the project idea.
